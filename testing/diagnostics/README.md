# Diagnostic Reports Directory

This directory contains diagnostic reports generated by the bulletproof testing framework.

## Privacy Notice

Diagnostic reports are **automatically excluded from git** via `.gitignore` because they contain:
- Personal file paths and usernames
- System environment variables  
- Computer names and system information
- Potentially sensitive configuration details

## Security Measures

The diagnostic toolkit automatically sanitizes sensitive information:
- Environment variables containing secrets are marked `[REDACTED]`
- Personal paths are marked `[SANITIZED]` or `[USER_PATH_SANITIZED]`
- Usernames and computer names are replaced with `[USER]` placeholders

## File Contents

Generated files follow the pattern: `diagnostic_report_[timestamp].json`

These files contain:
- System performance metrics (memory, CPU, disk usage)
- Detected issues with confidence scores
- Recommended solutions and auto-fix capabilities  
- Sanitized environment information

## Local Development Only

**These files should never be committed to version control** and are intended only for local troubleshooting and development environment validation.

## Cleanup

To clean up old diagnostic files:
```bash
# Remove files older than 7 days
find testing/diagnostics -name "*.json" -mtime +7 -delete

# Remove all diagnostic files
rm testing/diagnostics/*.json
```
